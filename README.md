I was tasked to create a game of rock paper scissors in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day four of the class. 

I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned within the last few days.

-If conditionals.

-Random module.

-Lists and the manipulation of lists.

-Troubleshooting IndexError.

-I focused on making this as concise as my abilities currently allow me to.

During this quick project I learned that I can use a variable that I stored in a list inside of a conditional statement. Before I would have created two variables when getting input from the user. One to use as an int for later conditonals and to use to index my list. The second to store whichever value the list got indexed to.

One problem I did have and wish to further research occured in the final conditional to determine the winner. In an attempt to make the code neater I stored the various print values within simple variables named: win, lose, and tie.

-For Example-

```python
win = print("You win!")
if rps_user == rock and rps_comp == scissors:
  win
```

Unfortunately, everytime I ran the program it would always print all three. Needs further research. 

Also, saving the ASCII art on another module and calling upon it would probably look cleaner.
